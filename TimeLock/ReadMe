Reads EPOCH time from stdin in the format YYYY MM DD HH mm ss (Ex. 2019 05 14 03 14 42)
Uses the computer's current time for current time
Can also hardcode the current time to be whatever you want it to be
Will print out a 4 character code as the answer
HOW TO RUN IN TERMINAL: python timelock.py < epoch.txt 
  epoch.txt is just a made up text file where the EPOCH time is in it.
HOW TO RUN IN TERMINAL ANOTHER WAY: echo "2019 05 14 03 14 42" | python timelock.py 
where after echo you can put any time that you want to be as the EPOCH time as long as it fits the format
