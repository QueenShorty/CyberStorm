#Infection 

#Windows
Created a continuous loop that I could not escape except to physically Hold down the power button. 
Then to restart my computer, It was not enjoyable to watch. I am just glad it was not that harmful

#Mint Linux
Lucky just the terminal got stuck in a loop untill it evenually crashed from lack of memory resources
(glad I learned to create a screenhot before)

Side note: I really enjoyed our assignment givin to us in binary for us to decode. Was very enjoyable

#The Code is a fork Bomb
A very not fun way to replicated itself till I run out of storage space and cashes

#attacker
Could use this to denial of user services, maybe during this attack they could steal information

#exit attack
Currently the only way to escape is to shut down your computer manually, and hope everything you were working on was saved.
