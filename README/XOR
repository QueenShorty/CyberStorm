PLEASE READ THIS PART FIRST:
  TO READ FROM KEY FILE, MAKE SURE THAT IN THE LIME THAT SAYS:
    with open("key", "r") as file:
             hold = file.read()
  MAKE SURE TO CHANGE "key" TO WHATEVER THE KEY FILE IS CALLED
Reads from a file in current directory (this is the key), then takes the plaintext/ciphertext from stdin
Sends ciphertext/plaintext (depending on if you are encoding or decoding) to stdout
HOW TO RUN ON TERMINAL (for converting from plaintext to ciphertext): python XOR.py < plaintext > ciphertext
  This takes the plaintext, converts to ciphertext, and then records the output into the file called ciphertext (can be called anything)
HOW TO RUN ON TERMINAL (for going from ciphertext to plaintext): python XOR.py < ciphertext
  Takes ciphertext and then sends the plaintext to stdout
